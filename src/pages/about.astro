          Recently I started a new event series - <a
            href="https://www.lu.ma/ai-demo-days"
            class="my-5 prose prose-neutral text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200"
            >AI Demo Days</a
          >
          , with the aim to bring together the London AI community to build a place
          where demos can become companies.

          Previously I spent time in consultancy building scalable event-driven
          applications for startups and enterprises on AWS.

          I retired from a short professional windsurfing career in December
          2020. Since then I have worked as a performance coach for junior and
          youth-age and olympic level athletes wanting to make waves on the
          international stage.
